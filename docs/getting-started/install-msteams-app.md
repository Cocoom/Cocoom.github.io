âš  **For your database to be directly associated with your Microsoft Teams, you must create it from the Cocoom application page in Microsoft Teams.**

Click on the button step 1: "**create your Cocoom platform**" in your personal Cocoom application.

a. Cocoom will ask you for the connection authorization with your Office 365 login and password.

b. Create your platform by entering :

- the name of your platform "xxx": free choice
- the address of your platform "xxxx.cocoom.com": according to the list of available URLs
- the use you wish to make of it "multiple choice": only one option available

c. Once you have completed this procedure, you can close the window, your platform is created and connected to your Microsoft Teams.


## 3. Associate your Cocoom to Microsoft Teams

If you already had an existing Cocoom platform before installing the Cocoom application within Microsoft Teams.

The procedure is simple, you just have to click on step 2: "**associate my Cocoom platform**" in the personal Cocoom app in Microsoft Teams.

**A login window appears, authenticate yourself with your usual login and password and then ask for the association of your platform with your Teams environment.**
