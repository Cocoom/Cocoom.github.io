# Choice of structure

## Knowledge Base

ðŸŒ± A **Cocoom knowledge base** represents an indivisible unit :
Even if the functionalities may vary from one profile to another, all users have access to the same information and authenticate themselves in the same way. A base is a common and shared space that cannot be divided into private subgroups.


> ðŸŒŸ Cocoom Philosophy : for us, knowledge management must be transversal and must not have any barriers, which is why we have decided not to hide or conceal information on a knowledge base.

**A base is characterized by fixed elements :**

- its unique URL: https://(your-name).cocoom.com
- its authentication system: simple or SSO

**A base is structured by variable elements:**

- #thematic threads: categories of publications
- #tags: publication filters


## #thematic threads

This is the obligatory and indispensable structure of your knowledge base!
The #thematic threads are the basic element that allow you to navigate through your knowledge and differentiate it. They function as categories.

A publication must be made in a #thematic thread, by default it can be named "General" or bear the name of the company.

A publication cannot be associated with two #thematic threads.

## Tags

Tags represent a second level of specification for a publication, they allow to add keywords that will simplify the sorting or searching of publications.

The tags are not associated with a particular #thematic thread and they are all at the same level, therefore perfectly transversal to your database.

## Hubs of knowledge bases

In some cases, you may need to create more complex structures, to compartmentalize knowledge or to manage your users differently.

A hub allows you to link several bases together.

**A hub consists of a mother knowledge base and one or more daughter knowledge bases.**

A mother knowledge base can have as many daughters as necessary but a daughter knowledge base can only have one mother.

The bases are **linked by the Cocoom support on demand** (see offer).

Once connected, these knowledge bases form a HUB, they are part of a single family and you will be able to create transversality between these bases.

**Each base has its own characteristics:**

- a unique URL
- an authentication system
- of users
- a structure of thematic feeds, tags

**The hub allows the exchange of information, via thematic feeds between these bases.**

**All bases can:**


- share a thematic thread: in reading / in reading - writing
- receive a thematic thread: reading / reading - writing

**Users remain independent but can be linked**

A user can have access to several bases in the same hub. He will then be able to switch from one base to another.

**Authentication is managed base by base**

Depending on the case, you can for a given database :

- have a simple access for external persons (partners, customers, suppliers...)
- have a specific SSO access (holding Azure client, SSO slack...)


## Good practices

We advise you to start simple !

Few thematic #threads to start creating a strong use and exchange on these restricted #threads.

Tag architecture must be thought from the beginning to best qualify the information and allow users to find it efficiently over time.

When you are considering a global deployment and the implementation of Hubs, we advise you to think about it upstream. A simple and effective technique is to **organize it in the form of mindmapping involving all stakeholders**.
