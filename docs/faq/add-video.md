# How to add a video in Cocoom

## Compliance

Cocoom allows the usage of videos coming from 3 streaming platforms:

- YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com)),
- Vim√©o ([https://www.vimeo.com](https://www.vimeo.com)),
- Microsoft Stream ([https://web.microsoftstream.com](https://web.microsoftstream.com/upload)), requires a subscription to Office365).

In the first 2 cases, the video will be broadcast publicly (either indexable by the platform, or only accessible via a URL without being listed on these 2 platforms).

In the last case, Microsoft Stream (which is offered with a Office365 business subscription) allows the distribution of private videos to your organization.


### YouTube

YouTube allows you to broadcast a public or "unlisted" video (accessible through a URL that can be used by Cocoom) : [Documentation link](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177)

## Cocoom usage

Thanks to the web link that you will have retrieved from the video of your choice, Cocoom then allows you to broadcast this video thanks to the "video" block present in the list of blocks from the Cocoom editor.
