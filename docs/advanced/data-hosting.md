# üåç Data hosting

## Infrastructure

We host our services and data at Gandi (gandi.net), in their secure datacenters located in the Paris region.


            Contractual Uptime: 99.95% (~20 minutes / month of downtime tolerated)

Our servers operate exclusively in a private network (VLAN).

As far as access to our technical infrastructure is concerned, no authentication is possible by simply entering a password, but only :

- By a two-factor authentication authorizing access to Cocoom's infrastructure management services,
- By an asymmetric key authentication (public/private) where only the keys of the few duly authorized persons are installed in our infrastructure.


## Sending e-mail

All emails sent to users are managed by a private sending system and managed end-to-end by Cocoom within our servers, emails do not transit on servers or third party services.
