## Multi-bases users

All the settings in this section can be set for 1 given Cocoom knowledge base and for 1 given user (identified by its email).

A user can be invited to be part of several knowledge bases. In that case, these settings can be different for each of them.

::: tip EXAMPLE
John Doe, Marketing Director of the company Acme has 3 different bases access associated to his email address :

- *acme.cocoom.com* : **contributor** on the global knowledge base of his company,
- *acme-marketing.cocoom.com* : **administrator** of the marketing service dedicated knowledge base,
- *mktg-club.cocoom.com* : **reader** on the external base dedicated to his marketing manager's club.
