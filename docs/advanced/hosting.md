## Infrastructure

The Cocoom solution is built above both the [Gandi IaaS services](https://www.gandi.net/en/cloud) and the [Microsoft Azure platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

::: tip MIGRATION
We are currently migrating everything left from Gandi infrastructure to Azure infrastructure.

**Migration will be fully completed in september 2020.**

Here is an high level architecture view of Cocoom
