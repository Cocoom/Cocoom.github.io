# Cocoom Presentation

## Philosophy


> ðŸŒŸ We want to help companies share their knowledge in a transversal and transparent way! We advocate for a responsible sharing of knowledge within companies to bring trust and transparency to all teams.



## Really simple to use

When you want to share knowledge within a team, an organization, a community, we allow you to create a common knowledge base.

**This base is a dedicated Cocoom platform, it has :**

- a specific URL

You can manage this knowledge base without special technical skills and these online guides allow you to be self-sufficient.

The creation of a platform is free of charge and can be done online at: https://start.cocoom.com/signup
