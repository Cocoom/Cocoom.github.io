# Cocoom Presentation

## Philosophy

> ðŸŒŸ We want to help companies share their knowledge in a transversal and transparent way! We advocate for a responsible sharing of knowledge within companies to bring trust and transparency to all teams.



## Really simple to use

When you want to share knowledge within a team, an organization, a community, we allow you to create a common knowledge base.

**This base is a dedicated Cocoom platform, with :**

- a personalized URL (you choose a subdomain)
- a structure and content that you create
- users you manage

**You can manage this knowledge base without special technical skills and these online guides will allow you to be self-sufficient.**

The creation of a platform is free of charge and can be done online : [Sign up page](https://start.cocoom.com/signup?lng=en)
