# Tabs in Teams

The great strength of Cocoom is to allow you to display your knowledge directly within your teams in dedicated tabs.



## Why Cocoom tabs in your teams?

**Feed your knowledge into your team**
You have direct access to your useful knowledge where you work.
e.g.: a marketing team adds a tab #‚ö°Ô∏èMarketing in its general channel and can thus feed, follow and consult all this knowledge without leaving the team.

**Sharing knowledge between two teams**
You can share a thematic thread between several teams, this allows you to create knowledge gateways between two or more separate teams.
e.g. the sales team adds a tab #‚ö°Ô∏èmarketing and can view the latest updates on the marketing team's productions

**Services available within your company**
You access all the thematic feeds of your Cocoom knowledge base, if other department have access to them and publish information, you can add these feeds directly in your tabs and benefit from their live knowledge.
e.g.: the HR team has created a #Welcome Booklet feed, which you can add to your team to help and follow the arrival of new people.



## Add a tab

Your Cocoom application must be connected to your team. When you add your first tab, select the Cocoom application and link it to your team if necessary.
