## Channels = Structure üéì

Your Cocoom visual knowledge base is organized in #thematic channels.

These #channels are the categories of knowledge that you will be able to associate to teams and add in the tabs. If you have administrator rights, you can modify the structure of your knowledge base to :

üëâ add, modify or delete #thematic channels

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_33DB8C50A65C2FB0F56B8E23D80EB4FDD5ADB7B9A9A15F5473F1D87424ECDED7_1589102982203_Plan+de+travail+12cocoom-guides-3.png)

A #thematic channel consists of :

- üîó Name : it needs a short and evocative name, spaces are allowed and you can add emojis in the channel name
- üìÑ Description : a short text that helps other members of the organization to understand the content of this channel of knowledge
- üèû Visual  : you can add a visual to represent the thematic channel, by default the visual takes the color of your thematic channel and a white #.
- üé® Color : your thematic channel is characterized by a main color. This color will be applied automatically in all memos, allowing readers to easily recognize the origin of a memo and to provide graphic consistency. You can select the color from the proposed palette or specify a Hexadecimal color code.

You will find this structure visible in the "knowledge base" tab, in "my Subscriptions" and when adding a Cocoom tab in your Microsoft Teams channels.

## Tags = filter üè∑

Tags allow you to add a level of specification to publications.

It is very important to think carefully about the tag structure and to make it evolve regularly because it allows you to filter the information in all Cocoom views.

‚ö†Ô∏è **To add a tag, enter the word or sequence of words and press "enter" to validate the addition. Don't forget to save all your changes.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **A newsletter is sent to all the users of your knowledge base, i.e. all the users present in the "users" tab, including those whose accounts are awaiting validation (an invitation has been sent but not validated by the user). Deactivated users do not receive it, however.**

## Breaking news üóû

This tab allows you to select up to 5 publications to be permanently displayed in the top banner of the "front page".

This page is the first visible page in your "knowledge base" consultation.

## Users üë®

Cocoom runs on a pre-provisioning mode which lets you freely choose exactly who has access to Cocoom from your organization.
The drawback is, for you as an admin, to keep users list synchronized with your organization turnover.

üëâ **Manually add all the email addresses of the users to invite, they will receive an email inviting them to create or link their account.**

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_33DB8C50A65C2FB0F56B8E23D80EB4FDD5ADB7B9A9A15F5473F1D87424ECDED7_1589103358196_Plan+de+travail+42cocoom-guides-2.png)

In the users management view you will be able to :

### **Add** a user

To add several users at once, you can simply copy/paste a list of emails in the dedicated text area.

You can also choose their profile.

You can :

- Change user profile: he could be 'administrator' as you are, 'contributor' ou 'reader'.
