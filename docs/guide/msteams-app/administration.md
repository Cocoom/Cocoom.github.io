## Administration Functionality

**Navigation is simple, the side menu allows you to :**

- see and manage all the publications of your Cocoom knowledge base
- view and manage all thematic feeds
- view and manage all tags
- design and send out newsletters
- select publications that will appear in the "front page".
- view and manage all users
- consult statistics and survey results on the entire knowledge base



## Publications

In this tab, you can see all the publications of all users.

**For each of them you have the possibility to** :

- modify
- unpublish
- delete

üìå **Tip**: if you need to create a publication involving several users, simply give them an "administrator" profile so that they can have sufficient rights to edit the same publication together.

## üéì Threads = Structure

Your Cocoom visual knowledge base is organized in #thematic threads.

These #threads are the categories of knowledge that you will be able to associate to teams and add in the tabs. If you have administrator rights, you can modify the structure of your knowledge base to :

üëâ add, modify or delete #thematic threads

A #thematic thread consists of :


- üîó Name : it needs a short and evocative name, spaces are allowed and you can add emojis in the thread name
- üìÑ Description : a short text that helps other members of the organization to understand the content of this thread of knowledge
- üèû Visual  : you can add a visual to represent the thematic thread, by default the visual takes the color of your thematic thread and a white #.
- üé® Color : your thematic thread is characterized by a main color. This color will be applied automatically in all memos, allowing readers to easily recognize the origin of a memo and to provide graphic consistency. You can select the color from the proposed palette or specify a Hexadecimal color code.

You will find this structure visible in the "knowledge base" tab, in "my Subscriptions" and when adding a Cocoom tab in your Microsoft Teams channels.



## üè∑ Tags = filter

Tags allow you to add a level of specification to publications.

It is very important to think carefully about the tag structure and to make it evolve regularly because it allows you to filter the information in all Cocoom views.

‚ö†Ô∏è **To add a tag, enter the word or sequence of words and press "enter" to validate the addition. Don't forget to save all your changes.**

## üóû Newsletter

The "Newsletter" feature allows you to design a newsletter from your knowledge base's publications and send it to all users.

‚ö†Ô∏è **A newsletter is sent to all the users of your knowledge base, i.e. all the users present in the "users" tab, including those whose accounts are awaiting validation (an invitation has been sent but not validated by the user). Deactivated users do not receive it, however.**


## üóû Breaking news

This tab allows you to select up to 5 publications to be permanently displayed in the top banner of the "front page".

This page is the first visible page in your "knowledge base" consultation.



## üë® Users

For other Microsoft teams users to have access to the Cocoom database, you have two possibilities :


- **Option 1, SSO** : You have connected Cocoom to the SSO of Microsoft teams during the installation of the application. This implies that you have high enough rights to authorize the connection between your Microsoft account and your Cocoom account.

üëâ Then manually add all the Microsoft email addresses of the users you want to invite. Then each of them will be able to connect with their Microsoft Office 365 login.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This solution is temporary and will be improved by Cocoom with the arrival of auto provisioning, the automatic addition of users to your teams.**


- **Option 2, manual** : You have not logged anything in, you have to manage the users manually. You must therefore invite them individually to create an account on the Cocoom database to log in.

üëâ Manually add all the email addresses of the users to invite, they will receive an email inviting them to create their account. Once this account has been created, they will be able to log in to Cocoom in Microsoft Teams with the identifiers they have chosen.
