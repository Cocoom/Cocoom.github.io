# First connection

When you first connect to Cocoom, you go through 3 steps of onboarding.

⚠️  **None of these steps is mandatory, you can click on "next" to continue.**

🚧  **You will be able to modify these information later in your dashboard.**


## Accept the terms of use

This is essential to move on further more.

## Choose your subscriptions

Your subscriptions are the Cocoom thematic channels that you wish to follow more closely.

When you select a feed from this list, all the publications it contains are in your selection:
**"knowledge base" tab > my selection**

You will also be notified by email each time there is a new publication in one of these feeds (only if you didn't read them).

You can modify your subscriptions at any time.
in : **"knowledge base" tab > my selection > manage my subscriptions**

## Fill in your profile

As a Cocoom user, you have a profile referenced in the Cocoom directory and visible to all other users of your knowledge base.

**Apart from your email, first and last name (automatically retrieved) all other fields are optional. You can go to the next step if you don't want to fill them in.**

To retrieve or modify your profile go to : Dashboard > my profile

👋 Some very useful tips to fill out your profile :


- the year of your date of birth does not appear
- to add a skill or superpower, tap "enter" to add the word or set of words to your list. otherwise it will not register 🙂
- to add a Linkedin profile, just copy/paste your profile address from Linkedin
- The "path" part is a free text field... you can see what you do with it!
- the chinese portrait is much more meaningful when you add emoji to it

::: tip
To bring up the emoji keyboard type :

- on windows : **windows** / **;**
- on mac : **control** / **command** / **space**
