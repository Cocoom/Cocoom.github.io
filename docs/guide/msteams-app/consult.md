# Consult

This section discusses in detail all the intricacies of consulting and interacting with publications and shares.


## Navigate with Threads

The thematic threads are used to navigate within Cocoom. They allow you to filter knowledge into different categories.

A publication or a share must be linked to a single thematic thread.

A thematic thread is characterized by :

- name
- description (optional)
- color
- visual (optional)

Cocoom thematic feeds are visible within Microsoft teams in :


- the Personal App: my knowledge base in the headlines
- team tabs: individual tab with a thematic thread
- 

The management of the thematic feeds is done by an Administrator in the Administration area of the personal App.


## Filter with tags

Tags allow filtering through a second level of specification for publications and shares. 

The tags are not linked to a thematic thread, they can be transversal to all publications.

The filter button, present on all thematic thread views, allows to filter with tags.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This button displays all the tags for your platform, it is not specific to a thematic thread. You can therefore have an empty result following the application of a tag on a thematic thread if the tag is not used in this thread. We are working to offer you a dynamic filter.**

The tag structure is managed by an administrator in the administration area of the personal App.


## Read Publications

**Publications are your knowledge within Cocoom.**

They are represented synthetically during navigation by "cards".
These cards have 5 different formats:

## Read Shares

**Shares are specific, short and interactive publications.**

They allow you to vote or click directly in the map to give your opinion, register for an event or consult a link.
These maps have 3 different formats (which have several variables) :
