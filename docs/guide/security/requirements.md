# ðŸ’» PrÃ©-requirements

## User's computer

OS compatibility : Linux, Windows or Mac.

Hardware: the user's workstation must be adapted to the use of current web applications. A color screen is necessary for the proper use of Cocoom.

Internet: the user's workstation must have Internet access.


## Browsers

Cocoom requires the use of a web browser to be used.
The browsers compatible with the Cocoom platform are the following:

- Safari 9
- Firefox version 43 or later
- Google Chrome version 47 or later
- Internet Explorer 11
- Edge
- Mobile Chrome (recent version, but not strictly determined)
- Mobile Safari (recent version, but not strictly determined)
- Mobile Edge

Javascript must be active on these browsers.


## Domain

Cocoom requires access to the cocoom.com domain (and therefore to all its sub-domains: *.cocoom.com).

Access to URLs starting with https://fonts.googleapis.com is mandatory in order to benefit from fonts adapted to the use of Cocoom.


## Port

Port 443 must be open on the following domains : *.cocoom.com and fonts.googleapis.com.


## Mail

A user must have an email address to be identified by Cocoom, to receive its accesses and personal notifications.

Cocoom sends e-mails to its users as part of their use :

- newsletter (sent by an administrator of your account)
- notifications on new unread publications (customized according to user preferences, can be disabled by the user).
- technical information (password, maintenance)

Minimizing as much as possible their number and the amount of information transmitted in each of them.

Ideally, these emails should be treated as non-spam by your internal anti-spam software (if you have one).


## Bandwidth excluding the use of videos

Per user, this requires, on the very first use:

- ~1,3Mo for access to the login page
- between ~3Mo and ~8Mo for access to the "index" page (Corporate -> selection) depending on the content produced by the collaborators
- between ~800Kb and ~3Mb to view a publication (weight varies according to the content of the publication)

Once the very first access is made by your employees, the download delta (bandwidth requirement) is reduced due to Cocoom's native use of web browser resource caches (on desktop, smartphone or tablet).


## Accessibility

There is currently no provision in our product for the visually or hearing impaired.
Except for the publisher of publications, the use of our tool does not require fine dexterity and can also be used on equipment with a touch screen.
