# Introduction

Cocoom is a Visual Knowledge* platform that allows you to share relevant, synthetic and attractive information within a team, an organization or a community.

**The Web App Cocoom is the online interface that allows you to manage it.**


## Tour of the Web App

- 📌 Consult your knowledge in the interface
- 🛎 Notify in a personal space and by email.
- 🎓 Organize all your knowledge and info with #threads and structured tags

If you have several Cocoom platforms, you can go further by connecting the different bases within a "hub".

The interface then allows you to switch from one to the other easily and to create and share thematic feeds.
