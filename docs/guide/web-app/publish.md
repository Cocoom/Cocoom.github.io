## Publication formats

Cocoom has two publication formats: ‚úèÔ∏è **publication** and üì£ **share**.

Each of these formats has several variants.


1. ‚úèÔ∏è **publication** : this is a long and complete format that allows you to structure a lot of information.

The publications have 5 different bases. 
These variants will have an impact on the map (summary visible in the thematic thread) and on the top of the publication in the header.

Click on "‚úèÔ∏è write" in the view of your choice then select a model 
‚ö†Ô∏è **you cannot change the template during the writing process.**


## Thread and tag selection

Start by selecting the topic thread to which you want to attach the publication and add tags if necessary.


## Edit content

**Header** 
The "header", i.e. the top part of the publication cannot be deleted, it is automatically formatted according to the publication base you have selected: basic, portrait, quote, document, poll.

‚ö†Ô∏è **if you want to change the format of the "header" you will have to start again from the beginning by selecting a new template.**

You can, on the other hand, modify the background image and the titles / subtitles.


**Introduction block**

The colored block with icons under the header is not mandatory, you can remove it or modify it at leisure.

However, we advise you to keep it and use it systematically in all your publications to make reading easier. 

Always use the same references to provide valuable information on the content of the memo.

**Arrange the blocks** 

Cocoom publications are made up of different blocks that can be moved, modified, duplicated or deleted.
