- view and manage all tags
- design and send out newsletters
- select publications that will appear in the "front page".

## Publications

In this tab, you can see all the publications of all users.

📌 Tip: if you need to create a publication involving several users, simply give them an "administrator" profile so that they can have sufficient rights to edit the same publication together.

## 🎓 Channel = Structure 

Your Cocoom visual knowledge base is organized in #thematic threads. These #threads are the categories of knowledge that you will be able to associate to teams and add in the tabs. If you have administrator rights, you can modify the structure of your knowledge base to :

👉 add, modify or delete #thematic threads

What is a thematic thread?
A thematic thread is a category to organize knowledge in your Cocoom.

A #thematic thread consists of :


- 🔗 Name: it needs a short and evocative name, spaces are allowed and you can add emojis in the thread name
- 📄 Description: a short text that helps other members of the organization to understand the content of this thread of knowledge.
- 🏞 Visual: you can add a visual to represent the thematic thread, by default the visual takes the color of your thematic thread and a # white
- 🎨 Colour: your theme thread is characterized by a main colour. This color will be applied automatically in all memos, allowing readers to easily recognize the origin of a memo and to provide graphic consistency. You can select the color from the proposed palette or specify a Hexadecimal color code.

To do this, click on your profile picture at the top right of your screen and then on Administration / Threads / Create a thread. Choose the name of the thematic thread, describe what it should contain in a few words, choose an image, a colour and check "Display in global navigation".



## 🏷 Tags = filter

Tags allow you to add a level of specification to publications.

It is very important to think carefully about the tag structure and to make it evolve regularly because it allows you to filter the information in all Cocoom views.

⚠️ **To add a tag, enter the word or sequence of words and press "enter" to validate the addition. Don't forget to save all your changes.**
