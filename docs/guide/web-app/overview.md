# Overview

Cocoom is a **Visual Knowledge** base that allows you to share relevant, synthetic and attractive information within a team, an organization or a community.

**The Cocoom Web App is the online interface that allows you to manage it.**


## Tour of the Web App

- ✍️  Publish memos (short and visual knowledge information) with an easy-to-use editor,
- 📌  Consult your knowledge information,
- 🛎  Notify people in their personal space and by email,
- 🎓  Organize all your knowledge and information with the help of #threads and structured tags,
- 👑  Administrate all content and users.

If you have several Cocoom knowledge bases, you can go further by connecting the different bases within a "hub".

The interface then allows you to switch from one to the other easily and to create and share thematic #thread.

To know more about it, please refer to the section [Structure your Cocoom](/getting-started/structure.md) or contact us: [support@cocoom.com](mailto:support@cocoom.com)
