# Overview

Cocoom is a **Visual Knowledge** base that allows you to share relevant, synthetic and attractive information within a team, an organization or a community.

**The Cocoom Web App is the online interface that allows you to manage it.**


## Tour of the Web App

- ✍️ Publier memos (short and visual knowledge), with an easy-to-use editor.
- 📌 Consult your knowledge in the interface
- 🛎 Notify in a personal space and by email.
- 🎓 Organize all your knowledge and info with #threads and structured tags
- 👑 Administer all content and users

If you have several Cocoom platforms, you can go further by connecting the different bases within a "hub".

The interface then allows you to switch from one to the other easily and to create and share thematic feeds.

To know more about it, please refer to the section [Structure your Cocoom](/getting-started/structure.md) or contact us: [support@cocoom.com](mailto:support@cocoom.com)
