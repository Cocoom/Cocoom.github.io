## Fill in your profile

As a Cocoom user, you have a profile referenced in the Cocoom directory and visible to all other users of your platform.

**Apart from your email, first and last name (automatically retrieved) all other fields are optional. You can go to the next step if you don't want to fill them in.**

To retrieve or modify your profile go to : Dashboard > my profile

👋 Some very useful tips for filling out your profile :


- the year of your date of birth does not appear
- to add a skill or superpower, tap "enter" to add the word or set of words to your list. otherwise it will not register 🙂
- to add a Linkedin profile, just copy/paste your profile address from Linkedin
- The "path" part is a free text field... you can see what you do with it!
- the chinese portrait is much more meaningful when you add emoji to it


TIP to bring up the emoji keyboard type :

- on windows : windows / ;
- on mac : control / command / space
