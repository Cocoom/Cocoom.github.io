# Personal App
Your personal application allows you to manage all your knowledge and to access Cocoom administration (if your profile allows it).


## Access your personal space

Your personal App is accessible from the App bar, the sidebar on the left.
You can access it from the 3 small dots, which lead you to all the apps available for you, or you can pin it to the App Bar so you always have it close at hand.

**Tip** : to pin your Cocoom Application in your App Bar, open Cocoom, right click on the application icon in the App Bar and click on "**ðŸ“Œ pin**".
