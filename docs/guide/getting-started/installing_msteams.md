# Installing App MS Teams

## 1. Install the application

First you need to install the Cocoom application in your Microsoft teams. Open the "Applications" tab of Microsoft Teams, you can then install it automatically or manually.

ðŸ‘‰ **From Microsoft Teams Apps store** 
Search for "Cocoom" in the Microsoft Teams application catalog.
Click on "install".

or

ðŸ‘‰ **Download the installation package** >> [App & Integration](https://cocoom.com/app-and-integrations/)
Be careful, you must have a sufficiently high fee to perform this operation. If this is not the case, get in touch with an Office 365 administrator in your organisation.

## 2. Create a Cocoom base

(if you have one, go to step 3)

Once the Cocoom application is installed, you must create a Cocoom base, your dedicated platform that will be integrated into Microsoft Teams.

âš  **For your database to be directly associated with your Microsoft Teams, you must create it from the Cocoom application page in Microsoft Teams.**

Click on the button step 1: "**create your Cocoom platform**" in your personal Cocoom application.

a. Cocoom will ask you for the connection authorization with your Office 365 login and password.

b. Create your platform by entering :

- the name of your platform "xxx": free choice
- the address of your platform "xxxx.cocoom.com": according to the list of available URLs
- the use you wish to make of it "multiple choice": only one option available

ðŸ‘‰ more information in the "create a platform" section

Once you have completed this procedure, you can close the window, your platform is created and connected to your Microsoft Teams.

## 3. Link your Cocoom and Microsoft Teams account

If you already had an existing Cocoom platform before installing the Cocoom application within Microsoft Teams.

The procedure is simple, you just have to click on step 2: "**associate my Cocoom platform**" in the personal Cocoom app in Microsoft Teams.

**A login window appears, authenticate yourself with your usual login and password and then ask for the association of your platform with your Teams environment.**

Given the current health crisis, we are committed to respond and activate your account within 12 hours maximum (much less during our opening hours: 08:30-18:30).

Is that all right ? Log in !
